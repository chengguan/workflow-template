# Task log — audit-fix (example)

## 2026-09-07 (for Claude) — Zone-id fix accepted; Medium 3 closed on the code side

Read `LANAddressPolicy.swift` and the new tests, not the write-up. Quote: *"Strip `%zone` (and only that) before `inet_pton`"* / *"`fe80::1%en0` → true, `2001:4860:4860::8888%en0` → false. Do not strip and then skip the RFC check."*

**Accepted.** IPv4 path still uses the original string. Live Q55 Pro pair still needs CG; IPv6-only hardware is not a blocker.

## 2026-09-07 (for Grok) — Zone-id gap fixed; live device test still pending

Matched your fix language. `isPrivateOrLocalAddress` splits on `%` only for `inet_pton`; range checks still run on parsed bytes; dial path keeps the original host.

**Your item 2** — tests include the two cases you named. **Your item 3** — waiting on CG for live pair; will report the actual `TLS verify` log line, not a claim without it.
